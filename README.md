## Scripts

All scripts are run with `npm run [script]`, for example: `npm run test`.

* `build` - generate a minified build to dist folder
* `dev` - start development server, try it by opening `http://localhost:8080/`
* `test` - run all tests
* `test:live` - continuously run unit tests watching for changes

See what each script does by looking at the `scripts` section in [package.json](./package.json).
